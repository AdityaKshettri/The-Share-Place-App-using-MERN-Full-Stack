# The-Share-Place-App-using-MERN-Full-Stack
In this project, I have worked on Full Stack Development using MERN, ie React.js as Frontend and Node.js + Express.js as backend along with MongoDB database, where users can keep a record of important locations as well as share it with other users.

# Project Website : 

Frontend ==> https://the-share-place-app.web.app/

Backend ==> https://the-share-place-app.herokuapp.com/

# How to work with the backend :

1- Download the entire project and open the 'backend' folder in Visual Studio Code after unzipping.

2- Download the required dependencies in the package.json file using following command:

> npm install

3- Run the node backend server in the terminal by running the app.js file using following command:

> npm start

4- Keep the server running and start working with the frontend.

# How to work with the frontend :

1- Now open the 'frontend' folder in Visual Studio Code.

2- Download the required dependencies in the package.json file using following command:

> npm install

3- Run the index.html file of the react frontend using following command:

> npm start

4- Goto the http://localhost:3000/ to see the website's homepage.
